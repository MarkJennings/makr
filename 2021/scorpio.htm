    <br><h1>Scorpio Research</h1><br>
    <p>Scorpio is a passively-balanced robotic manipulator developed by <a href="../2018/apptronik.htm" target="_blank">Apptronik</a>. Springs embedded in the robot compensate for the weight of successive linkages and a given payload in all configurations. As part of my graduate research, I developed a controller on this system for collaborative assembly tasks. </p>
    <p>Prior to my involvement, the robot was capable of scripting to joint states and Cartesian poses:</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://ros.org/" target="_blank">Robot Operating System</a> (ROS) was used to control Scorpio. ROS is an open-source project connecting the global robotics community to control a wide variety of robots and interface with all kinds of sensors and peripheral hardware.</p>
    <p>I made a ROS package that "jogs" the robot, taking Cartesian velocity inputs and streaming joint state commands to the robot using an inverse Jacobian method. Scorpio has 7 degrees of freedom, one more than is required for a given Cartesian pose. This redundancy was used to stay away from joint limits while jogging. Here I am using a 3D mouse to teleoperate Scorpio:</p>

    <p>My research focused on improving precision insertion tasks with heavy payloads. A bowling ball was used as the payload, with a raw spaghetti noodle at the base as the insertion member. These objects were chosen to model a given application while conveying the precise forces involved with the task.</p>
    <p>Interaction forces were detected with a Force/Torque (FT) sensor, and the weight of the post-sensor payload as well as a portion of its inertia were subtracted from this measurement to isolate operator forces. Then an admittance control law was used to convert these measurements to jogger inputs.</p>

    <p>I ran a pilot study with 6 untrained operators, challenging them to blindly insert the fragile pin into a hole at the base of a hemispherical cup. While the sample is small, preliminary results show an increase in operator success and a decrease in time required to complete the task.</p>
    <p>My work with Scorpio is more thoroughly covered in my Master's thesis - <i>Manipulator Control in Collaborative Assembly</i>. For now, I am off to work at Los Alamos National Lab, the funding agent for my graduate studies.</p>
